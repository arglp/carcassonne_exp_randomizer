Carcassonne Expansion Randomizer

What is it about?
My wife and I recently started playing a lot of the classic German board game Carcassonne. And we like to use different expansions every time. So I made a randomizer that allows that.
For now it is in Spanish, because my wife only speaks that language.

How it works?
It has a window with a sorting button. Klicking on it gives five symbols for five expansions.

Features
It has an adaptive randomizer. Meaning that the more an expansion has been chosen, the less likely it is to be chosen in the future.

Futures features:
- The option to change the settings in the application itself.
- The option to change the language.
- An hover text with the name of the expansion over the image.
- The possibility to choose more than five expansions.
